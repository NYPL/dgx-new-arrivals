# NYPL React boilerplate

Isomorphic React boilplate

The goods:
* ES6 - compile with Babel and Webpack
* Alt and Iso
* Webpack-dev-server


Meta Tags: Staff Picks and Book Lists currently use the react-doc-meta module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-doc-meta. This is not used here because this boilerplate is meant for simple, no router, apps and components.
